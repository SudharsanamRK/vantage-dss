# VANTAGE
VANTAGE is a high-performance, operational OS designed for modern aquaculture management.

# Output Modules:
**1. Dashboard**

 > Serves as the central mission control, providing a high-level aggregation of real-time telemetry, critical alerts, and key performance indicators (KPIs) to assess overall farm health at a glance.

**2. Pond Mapping**

 > Offers a spatial visualization of the farm's physical layout, allowing operators to track environmental variables and stock status geographically across different pond units.

**3. Feed Optimization Engine**
 
  > Utilizes bio-logic algorithms to calculate precise feed requirements based on current water quality and biomass, optimizing Feed Conversion Ratios (FCR) and reducing waste.

**4. Biomass Monitoring**
  
  > Tracks stock growth rates and population density in real-time, providing essential data on average body weight and total standing crop within each pond.

**5. Harvest Yield Forecasting**
  
  > Runs predictive simulations to estimate future output and ideal harvest windows, helping managers align biological readiness with market demand.

**6. Biosecurity Monitoring**
  
  > Functions as a digital health doctor, analyzing water parameters and behavior patterns to provide early warning signals for potential disease outbreaks or stress.

**7. Financial Performance Analysis**
 
  > Translates biological data into economic reality by tracking input costs, projected revenue, and overall profitability per cycle.

**8. Site Infrastructure**
 
  > Handles the technical foundation of the farm OS, where users define pond dimensions, species thresholds, and equipment calibrations.

**9. Event Notification System**
  
  > Manages the system’s "Signals," alerting operators via real-time notifications when sensor data or biological trends deviate from safe operational limits.

**10. Historical Data Repository**
  
  > Acts as a comprehensive digital logbook, storing historical cycle data and reports to facilitate long-term trend analysis and compliance auditing.
